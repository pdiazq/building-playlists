## Building a playlist (A MST (Minimum spanning tree) approach) 

As a part of the Visual Analytics course at Universidad de los Andes, I made this visualization is largely base on Jim's Vallandingham [scroller](http://vallandingham.me/scroller.html) 
to show the process of building a playlist out of [my top spotify artists graph](https://ss1993.github.io/my-spotify-top50/).

It also uses d3 v4 and [d3.legend](http://d3-legend.susielu.com/)

You can see a running demo [here](https://ss1993.github.io/building-playlists/)
